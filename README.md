# Slides from my talk at CSSCONF - Oakland 2014

I recently gave a talk at CSSCONF in Oakland. Here are my slides.

For those of you who attended - or to anyone who watches the [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/14N_V56tqd4),
I'd like to clarify a few points.

At one point I kind of champion inline styles. I forgot to clarify I mean the mental model that
inline styles provide. Inline styles are actually quite slow to render to the browser
as each declaration has a one to one relationship with the dom. A single purpose class however
i.e ```.bg-red { background-color: red; }``` has a one to many relationship with the dom and is
faster for the browser to paint. I find this is the same type of encapsulation - but it's far
easier to maintain.

I don't know if I somehow missed it during my talk or if slide 25 just didn't load for some reason - but I'd
be remiss to not call attention to the one quote that completely changed my workflow when writing css.

In Nicole Sullivan's post 'The media object saves hundreds of lines of code' she has the following quote:

> When Iâ€™m building a new object, the first thing I do is to figure out which parts are reusable components, and define what I know and do not know about them.

This is not something I had ever thought of before.
When I am building components I now stop and write out notes about all the things I know and all the things I don't know.
I've found that being informed on what you don't know, will help you in keeping concerns separated - and that your abstractions are on point.
Bad css is full of assumptions. Understanding where you can't make assumptions can help you write code that works in more contexts.

## All of CSS in one file
If you want to see my experiment with putting the entire css language into one file it's called [css unabridged](http://github.com/mrmrs/css-unabridged).
I've tried to make it as verbose as possible and it is currently 20.15kb minified and gzipped.

## Reading

These articles have helped change how I think about writing css,
html. Some of them are not actually articles about front-end development,
but still introduced concepts to me that changed how I approached authoring
code for users.

This article is a little more technical - but gives some interesting insight into how chrome handles painting to the screen.
